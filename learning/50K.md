# Blockchain Architectures: A 50,000-Foot View

This document provides a high-level overview of major blockchain architectures, categorizing them into five key groups.

## Group 1: Alternative High-Speed Layer 1s

### Solana (SOL)

**Category:** Layer 1, Non-EVM

**Core Identity:** Ultra-high-speed blockchain designed for high-frequency trading and on-chain games

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Non-EVM:** Uses Rust/C++ instead of Solidity
- **Proof-of-History (PoH):** Cryptographic clock for parallel processing
- **Monolithic Design:** Single layer for execution, settlement, and data

**Analogy:** Formula 1 race car - built for pure speed with custom parts

## Group 2: Specialized Blockchains

### Filecoin (FIL)

**Category:** Decentralized Storage Network

**Core Identity:** Decentralized storage marketplace for file sharing

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Storage Focus:** Primary purpose is reliable data storage
- **FVM (EVM-compatible):** Added later for programmability
- **Proof-of-Replication/Spacetime:** Verifies continuous data storage

**Analogy:** Global, crypto-powered Airbnb for data storage

## Group 3: Ethereum Scalers (EVM-Compatible)

### Polygon (MATIC)

**Category:** Ethereum Ecosystem / Sidechain

**Core Identity:** Fast, low-cost Ethereum-compatible environment

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Sidechain:** Separate blockchain with own validators
- **Ecosystem Vision:** Suite of scaling solutions including zkEVM
- **Expressway Analogy:** Faster parallel network to Ethereum

### Avalanche (AVAX)

**Category:** Layer 1, EVM-Compatible

**Core Identity:** High-speed platform with novel consensus and Subnets

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Avalanche Consensus:** Fast gossip-based agreement
- **Subnets:** Custom blockchains with own rules
- **Analogy:** Custom skyscrapers connected to main grid

### Starknet & zkSync

**Category:** Layer 2 ZK-Rollups

**Core Identity:** Layer 2s scaling Ethereum with zero-knowledge proofs

**Key Differentiators:**
- **ZK Tech:** Different proof systems (STARKs vs SNARKs)
- **EVM Approach:** Starknet uses Cairo VM, zkSync focuses on EVM
- **Analogy:** Accountant bundling transactions into verified proofs

## Group 4: Internet of Blockchains (Layer 0s)

### Cosmos (ATOM)

**Category:** Layer 0 / Blockchain Framework

**Core Identity:** Ecosystem of independent, sovereign blockchains

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Sovereignty:** Each app-chain is independent
- **IBC:** Standard protocol for blockchain communication
- **Cosmos SDK:** Toolkit for custom blockchain development

**Analogy:** United Nations for blockchain communication

### Polkadot (DOT)

**Category:** Layer 0 / Meta-chain

**Core Identity:** Platform providing shared security

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Shared Security:** Single Relay Chain secures all Parachains
- **Parachains:** Specialized chains with leased security
- **Analogy:** Central power plant for blockchain security

## Group 5: Modular Future

### NEAR

**Category:** Layer 1, Non-EVM

**Core Identity:** Sharded, developer-friendly blockchain

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Sharding:** Split blockchain into parallel shards
- **Usability:** Human-readable account names
- **BOS:** Modular hub for cross-chain dApps

**Analogy:** Supermarket with dynamic checkout lanes

### Celestia (TIA)

**Category:** Modular Data Availability Layer

**Core Identity:** Specialized layer for transaction ordering

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Modular Design:** Separates data availability from execution
- **Foundation for Rollups:** Cost-effective data layer
- **Analogy:** Public notary and bulletin board

## Conclusion

This overview provides a clear understanding of the major blockchain architectures, their core identities, and how they differ from each other. Each architecture represents a unique approach to solving blockchain scalability and usability challenges.
