# Understanding Execution Clients

An Execution Client (EL) is a critical component of modern Ethereum nodes, responsible for processing transactions, running smart contracts, and managing state. This document explains what Execution Clients are, their role in the post-Merge architecture, and their key responsibilities.

## What is an Execution Client?

### Pre-Merge vs Post-Merge Architecture

#### Pre-Merge (Monolithic)
- Single piece of software (e.g., Geth)
- Handled everything:
  - Networking
  - Proof-of-Work mining
  - Transaction execution
  - State management

#### Post-Merge (Modular)
Split into two specialized components:

1. **Execution Client (EL)**
   - Processes transactions
   - Runs EVM
   - Manages state

2. **Consensus Client (CL)**
   - Handles Proof-of-Stake
   - Manages validators
   - Controls block creation

### Analogy: Formula 1 Race Car

| Component | Role |
|-----------|-------|
| Execution Client | Car's Engine |
| Consensus Client | Driver |

The EL is like the engine:
- Processes fuel (gas)
- Executes commands
- Manages car's mechanics
- Follows driver's instructions

The CL is like the driver:
- Watches other cars
- Follows race rules
- Makes strategic decisions
- Controls the engine

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Transaction Processing
- Runs transactions through EVM
- Executes smart contracts
- Calculates state changes
- Ensures deterministic execution

### 2. State Management
- Maintains world state
- Tracks account balances
- Stores smart contract code
- Manages contract storage

### 3. JSON-RPC API
- Provides familiar namespaces:
  - `eth`: Core Ethereum methods
  - `net`: Network information
  - `web3`: Web3.js methods
  - `txpool`: Transaction pool
- Handles RPC requests
- Exposes blockchain data

### 4. Consensus Client Communication
- Listens for Engine API commands
- Processes `engine_newPayloadV2`
- Executes block transitions
- Maintains chain state

## Popular Execution Clients
